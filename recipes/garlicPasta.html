    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
      <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons dried parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Add garlic and stir
        until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter and stir constantly until
        melted. Pour in 3 cups chicken broth; add pepper and salt. Bring to a
        boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add spaghetti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to
        the bite, about 12 minutes. Add more chicken broth if pasta starts to
        stick to the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Parmesan cheese, cream, and parsley and mix until thoroughly
        combined. Serve immediately.
